# exam-timer

A bespoke, hand-crafted timepiece for use during exams.

## Why?

Not every lecture hall has a wall clock. Using this is less distracting than writing the current time on the board every 10 minutes.

TODO writing and erasing organizational details that become relevant at different times during an exam is distracting

Additionally, exams for large courses are commonly written in multiple locations at the same time. This tool helps enforce the same guidelines everywhere.

TODO no dependencies, client-only, simple configuration


## Usage

1. Take a look at the source code of `examtimer.html`. The "usage" comment around line 100 explains how to set things up. TODO more
2. Open `examtimer.html` in a browser and press the space bar to start the exam.


## Notes

* The first version of this timer (see commit `771a822`) was successfully used during the "Datenbanksysteme I" exam at the University of TÃ¼bingen in the winter of 2018.

* A hat tip to Tim Beckmann, whose [examclock](https://github.com/elogy/examclock) I've considerd forking after building the first version of this timer and before extending it to more-or-less match his clock's feature set. (Klausu(h)r ist der *beste* Wortwitz!)
